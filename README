DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a Dvorak international keyboard layout for use with
PC keyboards and the xkb keyboard mapper for X Windows.  It
should be compatible with most modern distributions of
GNU/Linux.

The layout features dead keys to make accents, plus various
useful symbols, including the euro sign.  It is suitable for
writing in English, German, French, Spanish, Hungarian, and
possibly other languages.

At the moment, no formal documentation is provided indicating
which key combinations map to which symbols.  You are
invited to read the source below (plus the pc/latin file) to
determine this for yourself. :)  In a nutshell, though,
special symbols are made using the AltGr (right Alt) key
in combination with a regular key; the combinations should
be fairly intuitive.  For example:

AltGr+a       -> ae ligature
AltGr+Shift+a -> AE ligature
AltGr+' a     -> a with acute accent
AltGr+" a     -> a with diaresis
AltGr+` a     -> a with grave accent
AltGr+~ a     -> a with tilde


INSTALLATION
------------
Append the contents of this file to the pc/dvorak file included
with your installation of xkb.  Normally this file is named
/etc/X11/xkb/symbols/pc/dvorak.  You will probably need to log
in as root to modify said file.  Here are the commands you need
to execute, assuming that this file has been saved in the
current directory as `dvorak.txt':

% su root
# cat dvorak.txt >>/etc/X11/xkb/symbols/pc/dvorak

How to configure your X server to use the Dvorak international
layout depends on your windowing environment.  In KDE 3.2.1,
for example, you need to do the following:

1. Open the KDE Control Center
2. Select "Regional & Accessibility" from the tree view.
3. Select "Keyboard Layout" from the tree view.
4. If "Dvorak" is listed in the "Active layouts" list, select it,
   and then activate the "<< Remove" button.
5. Select "Dvorak" from the "Available layouts" list and hit
   the ">> Add" button.
6. Select "Dvorak" from the "Active layouts" list and select
   "international" from the "Layout variant" drop-down box.

That's all there is to it!
